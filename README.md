Arduino Project: Oil Filling System
Description
This Arduino project aims to automate the filling of different oil products using a volumetric vacuum pump. The system allows up to 10 different volumes to be stored in the Arduino's EEPROM memory, providing great flexibility for filling different quantities of oil.

Features
Volume Storage: Up to 10 different volumes can be saved in the EEPROM memory.
Automatic Filling: Uses a volumetric vacuum pump for precise filling.
User Interface: An LCD screen and buttons for selecting and adjusting the volumes to be filled.
Reliability: EEPROM memory is used to retain volumes even after a system restart.
Hardware Used
Arduino Uno (or other compatible model)
Volumetric vacuum pump
LCD screen (16x2 or other)
Push buttons
External EEPROM module (if necessary)
Transistors and relays (to control the pump)
12V power supply (or according to the pump specifications)
